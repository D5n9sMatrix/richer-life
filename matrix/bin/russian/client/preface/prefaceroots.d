/** 
rotation matrices, and matrices arising from graph-theoretic approaches to
data analysis. These matrices have applications in clustering, data mining,
stochastic processes, and graphics; therefore, I describe these matrices and
their special properties. I also discuss the geometry of matrix algebra. This
provides a better intuition of the operations. Homogeneous coordinates and
special operations in IR3 are covered because of their geometrical applications
in statistical graphics.
