(The statement in quotes appears word for word in several places in the book.)
Standard textbooks on “matrices for statistical applications” emphasize
their uses in the analysis of traditional linear models. This is a large and im-
portant ﬁeld in which real matrices are of interest, and the important kinds of
real matrices include symmetric, positive deﬁnite, projection, and generalized
inverse matrices. This area of application also motivates much of the discussion
in this book. In other areas of statistics, however, there are diﬀerent matrices of
interest, including similarity and dissimilarity matrices, stochastic matrices,
