/** 
Only “selected” applications in data analysis are addressed; there are ap-
plications of matrix algebra in almost all areas of statistics, including the
theory of estimation, which is touched upon in Chapter 4 of Part I. Certain
types of matrices are more common in statistics, and Chapter 8 discusses in
more detail some of the important types of matrices that arise in data analy-
sis and statistical modeling. Chapter 9 addresses selected applications in data
analysis. The material of Chapter 9 has no obvious deﬁnition that could be
covered in a single chapter (or a single part, or even a single book), so I have
chosen to discuss brieﬂy a wide range of areas. Most of the sections and even
subsections of Chapter 9 are on topics to which entire books are devoted;
