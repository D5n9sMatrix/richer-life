Part I, consisting of Chapters 1 through 7, covers most of the material
in linear algebra needed by statisticians. (The word “matrix” in the title of
the present book may suggest a somewhat more limited domain than “linear
algebra”; but I use the former term only because it seems to be more commonly
used by statisticians and is used more or less synonymously with the latter
term.)
