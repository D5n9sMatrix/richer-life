Preface
I began this book as an update of Numerical Linear Algebra for Applications
in Statistics, published by Springer in 1998. There was a modest amount of
new material to add, but I also wanted to supply more of the reasoning behind
the facts about vectors and matrices. I had used material from that text in
some courses, and I had spent a considerable amount of class time proving
assertions made but not proved in that book. As I embarked on this project,
the character of the book began to change markedly. In the previous book,
I apologized for spending 30 pages on the theory and basic facts of linear
algebra before getting on to the main interest: numerical linear algebra. In
the present book, discussion of those basic facts takes up over half of the book.
