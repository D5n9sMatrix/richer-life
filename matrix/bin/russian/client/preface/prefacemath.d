/** 
In regard to the use of the book as a text, most of the book evolved in one
way or another for my own use in the classroom. I must quickly admit, how-
ever, that I have never used this whole book as a text for any single course. I
have used Part III in the form of printed notes as the primary text for a course
in the “foundations of computational science” taken by graduate students in
the natural sciences (including a few statistics students, but dominated by
physics students). I have provided several sections from Parts I and II in online
PDF ﬁles as supplementary material for a two-semester course in mathemati-
cal statistics at the “baby measure theory” level (using Shao, 2003). Likewise,
for my courses in computational statistics and statistical visualization, I have
provided many sections, either as supplementary material or as the primary
text, in online PDF ﬁles or printed notes. I have not taught a regular “applied
statistics” course in almost 30 years, but if I did, I am sure that I would draw
heavily from Parts I and II for courses in regression or multivariate analysis.
If I ever taught a course in “matrices for statistics” (I don’t even know if
such courses exist), this book would be my primary text because I think it
covers most of the things statisticians need to know about matrix theory and
computations.
