/** 
Essentially Disjoint Vector Spaces
If the only element in common between two vector spaces V1 and V2 is the
additive identity, the spaces are said to be essentially disjoint. If the vector
spaces V1 and V2 are essentially disjoint, it is clear that any element in V1
(except the additive identity) is linearly independent of any set of elements
in V2.
