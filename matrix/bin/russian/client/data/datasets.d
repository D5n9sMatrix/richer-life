2.1.1 Linear Combinations and Linear Independence
If a given vector can be formed by a linear combination of one or more vectors,
the set of vectors (including the given one) is said to be linearly dependent;
conversely, if in a set of vectors no one vector can be represented as a linear
combination of any of the others, the set of vectors is said to be linearly
independent. In equation (2.1), for example, the vectors x, y, and z are not
linearly independent. It is possible, however, that any two of these vectors
are linearly independent. Linear independence is one of the most important
concepts in linear algebra.
