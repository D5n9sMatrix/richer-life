then a1 = · · · = ak = 0. If the set of vectors {v1 , . . . , vk } is not linearly inde-
pendent, then it is possible to select a maximal linearly independent subset;
that is, a subset of {v1 , . . . , vk } that is linearly independent and has maxi-
mum cardinality. We do this by selecting an arbitrary vector, vi1 , and then
seeking a vector that is independent of vi1 . If there are none in the set that
is linearly independent of vi1 , then a maximum linearly independent subset
is just the singleton, because all of the vectors must be a linear combination
of just one vector (that is, a scalar multiple of that one vector). If there is a
vector that is linearly independent of vi1 , say vi2 , we next seek a vector in the
remaining set that is independent of vi1 and vi2 . If one does not exist, then
{vi1 , vi2 } is a maximal subset because any other vector can be represented in
terms of these two and hence, within any subset of three vectors, one can be
represented in terms of the two others. Thus, we see how to form a maximal
