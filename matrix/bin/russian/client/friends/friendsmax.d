/** 
Although vectors and matrices are fundamentally quite diﬀerent types of
objects, we can bring some unity to our discussion and notation by occasion-
ally considering a vector to be a “column vector” and in some ways to be the
same as an n × 1 matrix. (This has nothing to do with the way we may write
the elements of a vector. The notation in equation (1.2) is more convenient
than that in equation (1.1) and so will generally be used in this book, but its
use should not change the nature of the vector. Likewise, this has nothing to
do with the way the elements of a vector or a matrix are stored in the com-
puter.) When we use vectors and matrices in the same expression, however,
we use the symbol “T” (for “transpose”) as a superscript to represent a vector
that is being treated as a 1 × n matrix.
