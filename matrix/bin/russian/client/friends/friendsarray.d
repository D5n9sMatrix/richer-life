/** 
1.2 Arrays
Arrays are structured collections of elements corresponding in shape to lines,
rectangles, or rectangular solids. The number of dimensions of an array is often
called the rank of the array. Thus, a vector is an array of rank 1, and a matrix
is an array of rank 2. A scalar, which can be thought of as a degenerate array,
has rank 0. When referring to computer software objects, “rank” is generally
used in this sense. (This term comes from its use in describing a tensor. A
rank 0 tensor is a scalar, a rank 1 tensor is a vector, a rank 2 tensor is a
square matrix, and so on. In our usage referring to arrays, we do not require
that the dimensions be equal, however.) When we refer to “rank of an array”,
we mean the number of dimensions. When we refer to “rank of a matrix”, we
mean something diﬀerent, as we discuss in Section 3.3. In linear algebra, this
latter usage is far more common than the former.
