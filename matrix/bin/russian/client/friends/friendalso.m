# This is also sometimes called the Minkowski norm and also the Hölder norm.
# It is easy to see that the Lp norm satisﬁes the ﬁrst two conditions above. For
# general p ≥ 1 it is somewhat more diﬃcult to prove the triangular inequality
# (which for the Lp norms is also called the Minkowski inequality), but for some
# special cases it is straightforward, as we will see below.
# The most common Lp norms, and in fact the most commonly used vector
# norms, are:
A = 2500
Lp = norm(A)
p = 2

if ( p > 1 )
    x = 0
    dim = 200 
    vec(x, dim)
else 
  Lp
