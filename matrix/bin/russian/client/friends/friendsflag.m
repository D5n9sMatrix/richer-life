# Sets of various types of objects (functions, for example) can have norms,
# but our interest in the present context is in norms for vectors and (later)
# for matrices. (The three properties above in fact deﬁne a more general norm
# for other kinds of mathematical objects for which an addition, an additive
# identity, and multiplication by a scalar are deﬁned. Norms are deﬁned for
# matrices, as we will discuss later. Note that there are two diﬀerent kinds of
# multiplication used in property 2 and two diﬀerent kinds of addition used in
# property 3.)
