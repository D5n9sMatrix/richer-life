/** 
Vectors and matrices are useful in representing multivariate data, and they
occur naturally in working with linear equations or when expressing linear
relationships among objects. Numerical algorithms for a variety of tasks in-
volve matrix and vector arithmetic. An optimization algorithm to ﬁnd the
minimum of a function, for example, may use a vector of ﬁrst derivatives and
a matrix of second derivatives; and a method to solve a diﬀerential equation
may use a matrix with a few diagonals for computing diﬀerences.
