/** 
1.3 Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular or two-dimensional array. We speak of the rows and
columns of a matrix. The rows or columns can be considered to be vectors,
and we often use this equivalence. An n Ã— m matrix is one with n rows and
m columns. The number of rows and the number of columns determine the
shape of the matrix. Note that the shape is the doubleton (n, m), not just
a single number such as the ratio. If the number of rows is the same as the
number of columns, the matrix is said to be square.
