to refer to the set of all n Ã— m matrices with real elements.
We use the notation (A)ij to refer to the element in the ith row and the
th
j column of the matrix A; that is, in equation (1.3), (A)ij = aij .
Although vectors are column vectors and the notation in equations (1.1)
and (1.2) represents the same entity, that would not be the same for matrices.
If x1 , . . . , xn are scalars
