/** 
Many of the operations covered in the Ô¨Årst few chapters, especially the
transformations and factorizations in Chapter 5, are important because of
their use in solving systems of linear equations, which will be discussed in
Chapter 6; in computing eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and singular values, which
will be discussed in Chapter 7; and in the applications in Chapter 9.
