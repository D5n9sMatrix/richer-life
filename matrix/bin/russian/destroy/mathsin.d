Cones
A set of vectors that contains all positive scalar multiples of any vector in
the set is called a cone. A cone always contains the zero vector. A set of
vectors V is a convex cone if, for all v1 , v2 ∈ V and all a, b ≥ 0, av1 + bv2 ∈ V .
(Such a cone is called a homogeneous convex cone by some authors. Also,
some authors require that a + b = 1 in the deﬁnition.) A convex cone is not
necessarily a vector space because v1 − v2 may not be in V . An important
convex cone in an n-dimensional vector space is the positive orthant together
with the zero vector. This convex cone is not closed, in the sense that it
does not contain some limits. The closure of the positive orthant (that is, the
nonnegative orthant) is also a convex cone.
