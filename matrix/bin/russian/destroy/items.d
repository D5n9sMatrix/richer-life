/** 
Set Operations on Vector Spaces
Although a vector space is a set together with operations, we often speak of a
vector space as if it were just the set, and we use some of the same notation to
refer to vector spaces as we use to refer to sets. For example, if V is a vector
space, the notation W âŠ† V indicates that W is a vector space (that is, it has
the properties listed above), that the set of vectors in the vector space W is
a subset of the vectors in V, and that the operations in the two objects are
the same. A subset of a vector space V that is itself a vector space is called a
subspace of V.
