2 Vectors and Vector Spaces
x = 0. An alternative deﬁnition of a dot product using complex conjugates is
an inner product, however.) Inner products are also deﬁned for matrices, as we
will discuss on page 74. We should note in passing that there are two diﬀerent
kinds of multiplication used in property 3. The ﬁrst multiplication is scalar
multiplication, which we have deﬁned above, and the second multiplication is
ordinary multiplication in IR. There are also two diﬀerent kinds of addition
used in property 4. The ﬁrst addition is vector addition, deﬁned above, and
the second addition is ordinary addition in IR. The dot product can reveal
fundamental relationships between the two vectors, as we will see later.
