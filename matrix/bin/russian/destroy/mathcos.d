/** 
2.1.3 Basis Sets
If each vector in the vector space V can be expressed as a linear combination
of the vectors in some set G, then G is said to be a generating set or spanning
set of V. If, in addition, all linear combinations of the elements of G are in
V, the vector space is the space generated by G and is denoted by V(G) or by
span(G):
