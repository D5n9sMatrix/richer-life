A generating set or spanning set of a cone C is a set of vectors S 
= {vi }
ai vi ,
such that for any vector v in
C there exists scalars ai ≥ 0 so that v =
bi vi = 0, then bi = 0 for all i. If a generating
and if for scalars bi ≥ 0 and
set of a cone has a ﬁnite number of elements, the cone is a polyhedron. A
generating set consisting of the minimum number of vectors of any generating
set for that cone is a basis set for the cone.
