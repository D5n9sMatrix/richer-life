# 2.1.7 Metrics and Distances
# It is often useful to consider how far apart two vectors are; that is, the “dis-
# tance” between them. A reasonable distance measure would have to satisfy
# certain requirements, such as being a nonnegative real number. A function ∆
# that maps any two objects in a set S to IR is called a metric on S if, for all
# x, y, and z in S, it satisﬁes the following three conditions:

IR = 21

x = 0
y = 2
z = 4
S = 5

if (IR == 21)
  
  disp("Matrics and Distances")

else 
  
  y + z * S - x
 
end
