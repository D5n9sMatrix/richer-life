# hence, the triangle inequality holds. Therefore, given an inner product, x, y ,
# x, x is a norm. then Equation (2.18) deﬁnes a norm given any inner product. It is called the
# norm induced by the inner product. In the case of vectors and the inner product
# we deﬁned for vectors in equation (2.9), the induced norm is the L2 norm, · 2 ,
# deﬁned above.
