# Any function · deﬁned in this way satisﬁes the properties of a norm. It is
# easy to see that x satisﬁes the ﬁrst two properties of a norm, nonnegativity
# and scalar equivariance. Now, consider the square of the right-hand side of
# the triangle inequality, x + y:

x = 0
y = 3

if ( x != y )
  
  disp("Any defined this way")

else   
   x + y
end
