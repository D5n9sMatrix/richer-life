# 2.1.6 Normalized Vectors
# The Euclidean norm of a vector corresponds to the length of the vector x in a
# natural way; that is, it agrees with our intuition regarding “length”. Although,
# as we have seen, this is just one of many vector norms, in most applications
# it is the most useful one. (I must warn you, however, that occasionally I will
# carelessly but naturally use “length” to refer to the order of a vector; that is,
# the number of elements. This usage is common in computer software packages
# such as R and SAS IML, and software necessarily shapes our vocabulary.)

R = 21
SAS = 79
IML = 0

if ( R != SAS == IML )

   disp("I must warn you will")

else 

   R * SAS - IML 

end
