# Norms Induced by Inner Products
# There is a close relationship between a norm and an inner product. For any
# inner product space with inner product ·, · , a norm of an element of the
# space can be deﬁned in terms of the square root of the inner product of the
# element with itself:

a1 = 10
a2 = 20

A = 0
p = 21

seq = norm(A, p)
