# This expression holds for any norm · a and so, after obtaining similar bounds
# for any other norm · b and then combining the inequalities for· a and ·b ,
# we have the bounds in the equivalence relation (2.17). (This is an equivalence
# relation because it is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive. Its transitivity is
# seen by the same argument that allowed us to go from the inequalities involv-
# ing ρ(·) to ones involving · b .)
