# 2 Vectors and Vector Spaces
# is a normalized vector. Normalized vectors are sometimes referred to as “unit
# vectors”, although we will generally reserve this term for a special kind of nor-
# malized vector (see page 12). A normalized vector is also sometimes referred
# to as a “normal vector”. I use “normalized vector” for a vector such as x̃ in
# equation (2.21) and use the latter phrase to denote a vector that is orthogonal
# to a subspace.
x = 21
dim = 2500
seq = norm(vec(x, dim))
