# Convergence of Sequences of Vectors
# A sequence of real numbers a1 , a2 , . . . is said to converge to a ﬁnite number a
# if for any given > 0 there is an integer M such that, for k > M , |ak − a| < ,
# and we write limk→∞ ak = a, or we write ak → a as k → ∞. If M does not
# depend on , the convergence is said to be uniform.
